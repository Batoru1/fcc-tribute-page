# fcc-tribute-page

Just making these repos for fcc projects, but I dont like inbuilt text editor...

Now I use visual studio code and import it to fcc


 I passed this project with minimal styling and all

and when i styled it and it looks nice it wont check cuz...

"Your #image should be centered within its parent"

though I left it the same when  I have passed it...like so
#image {display: block;
max-width: 100%;
height:auto;
margin:auto;}

somehow now it wont register...though the image is centered and the page looks pretty descent....lol

So the solution was to put the #image in a wrapper (div class=hack /div) so the wrapper is  flex item, but the image itself is not....LOL

   I don't know what I've learned by this...but maybe...add another container, if you don`t know what to do? :DDD
