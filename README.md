# fcc-tribute-page

Just making this repos for fcc projects, because I dont like inbuilt text editor...

Don`t like the projects either, becauze they tell me what to do...
but I guess it`s usefull sometimes, if you don`t get whats going on

well ok..the projects are good...

but I passed this project with minimal styling and all

and when i styled it and it looks nice it wont check cuz...

"Your #image should be centered within its parent"

though I left it the same when  I have passed it...like so
#image {display: block;
max-width: 100%;
height:auto;
margin:auto;}

somehow now it wont register...though the image is centered and the page looks pretty descent....lol

btw i use visual studio code and import it to fcc
